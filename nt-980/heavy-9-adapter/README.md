The Norbauer Heavy-9 can't support flexible plates with out an adaper to transfer the connecting load from the plate to the back of the PCB. 
(Would crack the plate by using the standard mounting system.)

Need:
* 4x Side adapters
* 1x Center adapter 
* 5x Screws: M4-0.7 x 16mm

The USB plate adapter is ment to work with the universal daughterboard project.  It works okay but could use a little more refinement

Use at your own risk!
